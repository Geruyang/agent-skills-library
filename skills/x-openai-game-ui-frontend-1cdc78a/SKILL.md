### 导出副本边界与技能别名

迁移、安装、修复和经验回写只作用于当前加载的目标宿主技能副本。原 Codex 技能/MCP、下载的源码和 `original-skills` 均为来源材料，不因执行本副本而写入；只有用户另行明确要求配置 Codex 产品本身时，才按该产品流程处理指定目标。脚本需要安装目录或状态目录时，显式提供目标路径；不得从 `CODEX_HOME` 隐式推断写入位置。

跨技能名称可能沿用源库别名。先查 [技能别名表](../../skill-aliases.json)，优先选择同来源、同插件的条目，再使用其 `id` 调用或读取对应入口；不得假定旧 `$skill`、`superpowers:skill` 名称在新宿主直接注册。不能确定目标时先核对，不替换真实产品命令或 Shell 环境变量。

## 跨宿主使用约定

本副本供支持 Agent Skills 的客户端使用。先检查当前宿主实际提供的工具、权限和已连接服务，再执行正文工作流。原文中的宿主工具标识是能力参考；只有实际发现该工具时才可调用，其他宿主应使用经核验的等价 MCP、CLI 或 API。没有等价能力的步骤必须报告不可用，不能虚构调用或完成状态。

技能资源以本技能目录为基准；输出写入当前项目中用户指定的位置。通过技能名称或自然语言触发，具体快捷命令由宿主决定。涉及真实产品、模型 API、协议字段和官方网址的名称保持原意。授权、审批、隐私和工具范围限制在迁移后仍然有效；不得为兼容而扩大权限。具体依赖与迁移说明见同目录 `PORTABILITY.md`。

# Game UI Frontend

## Overview

Use this skill whenever the game needs a visible interface layer. The job is not to produce generic dashboard UI. The job is to produce a readable, thematic browser-game interface that supports the play experience.

Default assumption: build the game world in canvas or WebGL, and build text-heavy UI in DOM.

## Frontend Standards

1. Establish visual direction before coding.
   - Genre and fantasy
   - Material language
   - Typography
   - Palette
   - Motion tone
2. Use CSS variables for the UI theme.
3. Build clear hierarchy.
   - Critical combat or survival information first
   - Secondary tools second
   - Rarely used settings behind menus or drawers
4. Protect the playfield first, especially in 3D.
   - The initial screen should feel playable within a few seconds.
   - Default to one primary persistent HUD cluster and at most one small secondary cluster.
   - Keep the center of the playfield clear during normal play.
   - Keep the lower-middle playfield mostly clear during normal play.
   - Put lore, field notes, quest details, and long control lists behind drawers, toggles, or pause surfaces.
   - Prefer contextual prompts and transient hints over permanent boxed panels.
5. Keep overlays readable over motion.
   - Use backing panels, edge treatment, contrast, and restrained blur where needed.
6. Design for both desktop and mobile from the start.
7. Design 3D UI around camera and input control boundaries.
   - Pause or gate camera-control input when menus, dialogs, or pointer-driven UI are active.
   - Keep pointer-lock, drag-to-look, and menu interaction states explicit.

## 3D Starter Defaults

For exploration, traversal, or third-person starter scaffolds, prefer this UI budget:

- one compact objective chip or status strip at the edge
- one transient controls hint or interaction prompt
- one optional collapsible secondary surface such as a journal, map, or quest log

Do not open every informational surface on first load. The scene should be readable before the user opens any deeper UI.

As a default implementation constraint for 3D browser games:

- no always-on full-width header plus multi-card body plus full-width footer layout
- no large center-screen or lower-middle overlays during normal movement
- no more than roughly 20-25% of the viewport covered by persistent HUD on desktop unless the user explicitly requests a denser layout
- on mobile, collapse to a narrow stack or contextual chips before covering the playfield with larger panels

## Prompting Rules

When asking the model to design or implement game UI, include:

- the game fantasy
- the camera or viewpoint
- the player verbs
- the HUD layers
- the camera or control mode when the game is 3D
- the tone of motion
- desktop and mobile expectations
- playfield protection and disclosure strategy
- explicit anti-patterns to avoid

Use `../../resources/plugins-6ebaff11/plugins/game-studio/references/frontend-prompts.md` for concrete prompt shapes.

## Motion Rules

- Prefer a few meaningful transitions over constant micro-animation.
- Reserve strong motion for state change, reward, danger, and onboarding.
- Respect reduced-motion settings for non-essential animation.
- Keep 3D HUD motion from competing with camera motion.

## What Good Looks Like

- HUD elements are legible without flattening the scene.
- Menus feel native to the game world, not like a SaaS admin panel.
- Layout adapts cleanly across breakpoints.
- Pointer, keyboard, and game-state feedback are obvious.
- In 3D games, menu and HUD states do not fight camera control or pointer-lock.
- In 3D games, the first playable view keeps most of the viewport available for movement, aiming, and spatial reading.
- Persistent information density is low enough that screenshots still read as game scenes, not UI comps.

## Anti-Patterns

- Generic app dashboard layouts
- Flat placeholder styling with no theme
- Default font stacks without intent
- Dense overlays that obscure the playfield
- Large title cards or multi-paragraph notes sitting over a live playable scene
- Equal-weight boxed panels distributed around every edge of the viewport
- Controls, objectives, notes, and lore all expanded at once on first load
- Full-width top-and-bottom chrome with large always-on center or body panels in 3D play
- Excessive motion on every element
- Canvas-only UI when DOM would be clearer and cheaper
- Forcing HUD controls into the 3D scene when standard DOM would be clearer
- Letting camera input remain active under modals or inventory panels
